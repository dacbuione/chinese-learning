## 🔄 **SEQUENTIAL LEARNING FEATURES**

### **Unlock Logic**
```typescript
// Lessons unlock based on:
1. Prerequisites completion (previous lessons)
2. Minimum score requirements (e.g., 70% to unlock next)
3. Required XP accumulation
4. Time gates (optional delay between lessons)
```

### **Progress Tracking**
```typescript
// Enhanced tracking includes:
- Lesson progress percentage (0-100%)
- Exercise completion scores
- Time spent on each lesson/exercise
- Number of attempts per exercise
- Learning streak maintenance
- XP accumulation system
```

### **Visual Feedback**
```typescript
// Status indicators:
🔒 LOCKED - Requirements not met
▶️ AVAILABLE - Ready to start
⏸️ IN_PROGRESS - Currently learning
✅ COMPLETED - Finished successfully
⭐ MASTERED - Excellent performance
```

## 🎨 **UI/UX ENHANCEMENTS**

### **Lesson Cards**
- ✅ Type indicators with Chinese characters (词汇, 语法, 发音, 写字)
- ✅ Status badges with clear visual hierarchy
- ✅ Progress bars for active lessons
- ✅ Score displays for completed lessons
- ✅ Unlock requirement messages for locked lessons
- ✅ Responsive design for mobile/tablet/desktop

### **Learning Path Navigation**
- ✅ Next lesson recommendation
- ✅ Overall progress statistics
- ✅ Streak tracking and XP display
- ✅ Smooth transitions and animations
- ✅ Error handling with retry options

---

## 📱 **MOBILE-FIRST DESIGN**

### **Responsive Breakpoints**
```typescript
mobile: 0-767px    // Single column, large touch targets
tablet: 768-1023px // Two columns, landscape support  
desktop: 1024px+   // Three columns, hover effects
```

### **Vietnamese Localization**
- ✅ All UI text in Vietnamese
- ✅ Chinese characters properly displayed
- ✅ Cultural learning context preserved
- ✅ Tone indicators with Vietnamese names

## 🧪 **TESTING STRATEGY**

### **Backend Testing**
```bash
# Test sequential learning endpoints
curl -X GET "http://localhost:3000/api/v1/progress/learning-path/{userId}"
curl -X POST "http://localhost:3000/api/v1/progress/lesson/{lessonId}/user/{userId}"
curl -X GET "http://localhost:3000/api/v1/progress/stats/{userId}"
```

### **Frontend Testing with Playwright**
```typescript
// Test lesson unlock flow
1. Navigate to lessons page
2. Verify locked lessons show unlock requirements
3. Complete prerequisites and verify unlock
4. Test lesson progress tracking
5. Verify status updates and XP accumulation
```

### **Integration Testing**
```typescript
// End-to-end learning flow
1. User starts first lesson (should be available)
2. Complete lesson with passing score
3. Next lesson unlocks automatically
4. Progress and XP update correctly
5. Streak counter increments
```
